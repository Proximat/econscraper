The method of typography employed in the composition of 
this volume, in which the " justification " of lines is dispensed with, 
has been in use more than two years on the publisher's periodical, 
Liberty, to the satisfaction of himself and of his readers. Its ad- 
vantages are undeniable. From the standpoint of aesthetics it is an 
improvement, because by it absolutely perfect spacing is secured. 
From the standpoint of economy it is almost a revolution, since it 
saves, in the case of book work, from twenty to forty per cent, of 
the cost of type-setting, according to the grade of the work. If 
adopted in all printing-offices, it would effect a daily saving of the 
labor of about two hundred thousand men.

PUBLISHER'S PREFACE. 



The series of newspaper articles comprising 
this little volume appeared originally in the 
New York " Tribune," of which their author 
was at the time, I believe, the managing editor ; 
and a little later in " The Spirit of the Age," 
a weekly paper published in New York in 
1849 by Fowlers &lt;fc Wells and edited by Rev. 
William Henry Channing. It is from the 
pages of the latter periodical that I collate 
them. Evidence is not lacking that, in so do- 
ing, I but realize a design long cherished by 
their now distinguished author, the present 
editor of the New York " Sun " and unques- 
tionably the foremost journalist of the United 
States ; for Editor Channing took pains to ac- 
company the republication of the series in his 
paper by a foot-note, in which he stated that 
the articles had already appeared in the 



IV PREFACE 

" Tribune," but that " Mr. Dana, judging them 
worthy of being preserved in a form convenient 
for binding, has consented to revise them for 
our paper." Unfortunately there is more and 
stronger evidence to warrant the belief that 
Mr. Dana will greet my efforts to still more 
permanently preserve them with anything but 
cordiality. In anticipation, then, of his re- 
sentment, I present to him my regrets at being 
the occasion and the instrument of his discom- 
fiture, and offer for sole excuse the maxim, 
Sahts populi suprema est lex. For, indeed, it 
must contribute not a little, in my judgment, 
to the safety of the people to make it widely 
known that he who is to-day traducer-in -chief 
of all who stand for the people and are actuated 
by a desire for the people's welfare was once, 
and in the very prime of his life (at the age of 
thirty), as earnest a defender of the people's 
interests and as ardent an admirer of the peo- 
ple's champions as is, for instance, the hairy 
Anarchist who pens this preface or the shaven 
Nebraskan whom politics has made, at the 
present moment, the most conspicuous target of 
Mr. Dana's most biting shafts. Nay, he knew 
no such moderation as that which characterizes 
the men whom he now denounces ; in proof of 
which I may cite the concluding sentences of a 
letter on " The European Revolution " which 



X 



PREFACE V 

appeared in " The Spirit of the Age " of 
August 18, 1849, over Mr. Dana's initials, 
written in protest against criticism that had 
been passed upon the violence of the revolu- 
tionary movement in France. 

" Would to God that this hot and bloody 
struggle were over, and that Peace might come 
at last to the world I And yet I invoke no 
seeming peace that the weaker may ever anew be 
plundered, but a peace with Liberty, Equality, 
and honest marts and not robber's Order for its 
condition. "What is the way to such a peace f 
Through war and destruction, through such 
war as that at Home, and that in Hungary, — 
perhaps, too, through such as that of June, 
18Jf8, in Paris. The history of the past and 
the examples of the present instruct us that the 
privileged and powerful, by whatever name they 
are called, do not yield their privileges except as 
they are compelled. When will Mussia lay 
aside the pretension to dictate darkness and 
despotism to Europe ? When she is compelled. 

When will the bourgeoisie consent to live by 
their own labor, and not by the labor of others f 

When they are compelled. How can that com- 
pulsion be exercised? In a free State through 
the ballot and the independent action of the peo- 
ple under the influence of ideas. How shall 



VI PREFACE 

States be made free, so that ideas and the people 
may act ? Hitherto Providence has freed them 
by revolution, nor is it apparent that other 
means are now to be employed. It may be that 
the day of revolutions is past, but, if so, why 
are they there in such abundance ? . . . Let 
others give aid and comfort to despots. Be it 
ours to stand for Liberty and Justice, nor fear 
to lock arms with those who are called hot-heads 
and demagogues, when the good cause requires" 

Contrast this utterance with the ravings 
about " the red mob" and " the wild light of 
Anarchy " with which Mr. Dana daily fills the 
editorial columns of the " Sun." Contrast it 
with his assertion that Grover Cleveland " is as 
inflammatory in language, as fierce against 
wealth, as provocative of the hatred of the 
crank and the tramp against society, as the 
wildest ranter that ever scattered hayseed and 
epithets in a Populist convention." Contrast it 
with his sneering characterization of Cleveland 
as " the Proudhon of Buzzard's bay," when the 
articles here collated prove beyond a doubt 
that, in Mr. Dana's real belief, to liken a man 
to Proudhon is to bestow on him the highest 
honor. And reflect that this torrent of abuse 
comes, not from one of those " silly editors 
who never read a book of Proudhon's," rebuked 



PREFACE Vll 

by Mr. Dana in this volume, but from an editor 
who knows precisely what he is talking about, 
— from an editor who, as the subsequent pages 
show, has expounded and advocated the doc- 
trines of Proudhon (the first man to specifically 
declare himself an Anarchist) with so great 
ability and insight as to make his exposition, in 
my view as in his own, worthy of preservation. 
Is it not pitiful ? 

Far it be from me to condemn an honest 
change of view. But, when Mr. Dana vehe- 
mently reviles by wholesale the men who hold to 
opinions much less extreme than those which he 
once upheld from the highest motives and with 
the most intense enthusiasm, he cannot be 
credited with sincerity. It must be said of him 
as he recently said of a certain United States 
senator : 

" He is trying to deceive the people, though 
he does not deceive himself. He is telling them 
lies, knowing them to be lies."

PROUDHON 

AND HIS "BANK OF THE PEOPLE." 



I.* 

M. Proudhon has of late been one of the 
most prominent men in Europe, or, as sohie 
writers might say, the most notorious. He has 
enjoyed the distinguished honor of being 
talked about in the newspapers, and his name 
has figured in dispatches received by magnetic 
telegraph. 

Since his imprisonment for libel on President 
Bonaparte, we have not indeed heard often of 
him in the active world, but his writings remain 
to instruct, alarm, or amuse, according to the 
nature of their readers. His system, if system 
it be, is still there, and is still a regular subject

for discussion. Monthlies and quarterlies de- 
vote long articles to discussions of his sayings 
and doings, trembling for the welfare of the 
continent which contains such a destructive. 
M. Guizot, in his late book on Democracy in 
France, confesses that he is the ablest of the 
Socialists as well as the most terrific, and then 
launches into a refutation of his doctrines so 
weak and shallow as to provoke only a smile 
from those who happen to be too well informed 
to be imposed on by its gravity and the 
elegance of its style. The daily journals of 
Paris and London, with few exceptions, have 
learned to sing the same song. Any one of 
them stands ready to affirm that Proudhon is 
an atheist and a madman, a Communist burn- 
ing to plunder the wealthy, the living incarna- 
tion of immorality, disorder, and folly. These 
things are, of course, repeated on this side of 
the water, and silly editors, who never read a 
book of Proudhon's and know no more of his 
character than they do of his ideas, take their 
cue from European brethren and make them- 
selves ridiculous by talking at second or third 
hand what was little else than a mixture of

ignorance and spite at first. We humbly pro- 
test against such a mode of deciding upon the 
merits of a man who, whatever be his faults as 
a thinker, must be admitted, on a more careful 
observation, to possess a remarkable degree of 
originality and vigor of mind as well as of 
honesty and moral courage. We propose, as 
briefly as possible, — more briefly, indeed, than 
is consistent with a just statement of Prou- 
dhon's doctrines, — to explain the leading points 
of his philosophical and economical system. 
First, however, it is proper to notice the facts 
of his personal history. 

P. J. Proudhon was born at Besancon, in the 
department of Doubs, — a region noted for the 
energy and talent of its natives, — in the year 
1809, and is accordingly now forty years old. 
His father was a cooper, and his childhood 
was passed among the people. The circum- 
stances of his early life no doubt contributed 
something to form in him the unyielding hos- 
tility to everything that burdens and keeps 
down the masses which is one of his character- 
istics. As a boy, he was remarkable for talent, 
originality, and obstinacy. He had an uncle 



4 PROUDHON 

who was professor of law at the Royal College 
of Dijon. Attracted by the brightness of his 
nephew, he procured for him a free scholarship 
in that college.* As a student, he carried all 
before him, being as industrious as he was 
gifted. The most abstruse subject was clear 
to his penetration ; he knew at once lessons 
over which others long and wearily drudged; 
his memory lost nothing that it had ever 
seized ; and a weariless activity made his studies 
as extensive as they were thorough. He gradu- 
ated with a reputation as brilliant as it was well 
earned, and no one could have had reason to 
doubt that fame and fortune awaited him in 
whatever profession he might choose. 

But the young student was not like his com- 
panions. The learned professions did not 
tempt him ; he fancied that in none of them 
could be found that independence which he 
knew to be the first want of his nature. He 
must have for himself a position in which his 
daily bread would never have to be earned by 

* Sainte-Beuve, in his life of Proudhon, says that 
Jie was a cousin of the Dijon professor, but makes no 
mention of this free scholarship. — Publisher's Note. 



PEOUDHON 5 

refraining to express what was a conviction, 
or expressing what was not. Lying, in all 
shades, was to him the most distasteful of all 
things. In his love of freedom and hatred of 
hypocrisy there was something almost savage. 
Less compact, intense, and consistent in his 
character than that other distinguished native 
of Besancon, Charles Fourier, he was equally 
resolute and more uncompromising. He de- 
termined to learn a mechanical trade, and his 
scholarly habits and tastes naturally led him to 
become a printer. 

It was not long before the quickness of 
young Proudhon had mastered all the mysteries 
of typography, and he became an excellent 
workman. He was soon noticed by the chiefs 
of the establishment, and made a proof-reader. 
In this capacity his knowledge of Greek, Latin, 
and Oriental languages was of great service; 
he was employed in correcting learned works at 
a higher salary than ordinary proof-readers. 
His labor gave him a living, and there was no 
reason why he should not follow his bent. His 
thinking was much directed to metaphysical 
subjects ; political economy was also a favorite 



G PBOUDHON 

theme of his reflections, but, on the whole, 
philosophy had the preference. He dug into 
the obscurities 'of the Germans, searched the 
pantheisms of India and China, and found satis- 
faction in the vigorous logic of Aristotle and 
the glorious eloquence and glowing trans- 
cendentalism of Plato. Of all these systems 
that of Hegel has perhaps had the most influ- 
ence upon his mind ; this influence is especially 
manifested in his largest and ablest work, 
" The Contradictions of Political Economy," * 
where he sets the doctrines of opposing schools 
of economists to destroying each other some- 
what after the fashion of the Kilkenny cats. 
But, however this may be, the learning of M. 
Proudhon in the systems of philosophical 
writers is immense. We know privately that 
Mr. Morrell of London, author of the recent 
history of modern philosophy, regards him as 
almost unequaled in this respect. 

* " System of Economical Contradictions " is the 
correct translation of the title of the book here referred 
to. The statement that this work is Proudhon *s 
largest was true when Mr. Dana was writing this 
series of articles, but it is not true now. — Publisher's 
Note. 



PROUDHON 7 

Of course, his sayings and writings during 
this period were not calculated to insure for 
him the reputation of a sound and safe person. 
He was always noted for the boldness of his 
ideas and the fearlefisness with which they were 
uttered. He cared less about having what he 
said to-day in perfect harmony with what he 
said yesterday than that it should be the ex- 
pression of his present thought. This sort of 
honesty he preserves still, and, when he 
changes his mind or gets a new idea, is never 
afraid to say so. Then, as now, he frightened 
many who came in contact with him, but al- 
ways commanded the respect of all by the 
sturdy vigor and courage of his moral and 
mental constitution. 

While toiling in this double capacity of proof- 
reader and student, the academy of his native 
city proposed, in its regular list of subjects for 
prizes, "The Observation of the Sabbath." 
Proudhon wrote upon it, and his book gained 
the prize. It has been widely circulated and 
everywhere praised, especially by the religious. 
It maintains with much power the divine wis- 
dom of the Mosaic law in general and of that 



8 PROUDHON 

ordinance establishing the Sabbath in partic- 
ular. Some people wonder how such a radical 
and destructive could have written such a book ; 
they do not comprehend him, that is all. 

The prize gained was 1,800 francs ($360) a 
year, for three years, to be expended at Paris 
in completing his studies. He went there and 
wasted no time, laboring for the most part in 
the same directions as before, — namely, meta- 
physics and political economy. Afterward he 
went back to Besancon and set up a printing 
establishment on his own account, in which he 
succeeded ; other industrial enterprises in which 
he engaged also bore witness, by turning out 
well, to the fact that all of his talent does not 
lie in the use of his pen. He has also been en- 
gaged in other enterprises, but never got rich, 
having always been drawn off by the necessity 
of writing. When once he was offered a large 
sum to engage in a business in which there 
was a certainty of making a fortune, but would 
have required his undivided attention, he re- 
fused, saying that his force was in his poverty. 

It is as a journalist and since the Revolution 
that he has taken the large place he now oc- 



PROUDHON 9 

cupies before the public. He began on the 1st 
of April, 1848, the publication of a daily penny- 
paper at Paris called the " Representant du 
Peuple." Gen. Cavaignac suppressed it in 
June; it appeared again when the interdict was 
removed from the journals generally ; it was 
suppressed again August 21, and reappeared 
October 31, under the title of " Le Peuple," 
Its numbers were afterwards seized many times, 
according to the arbitrary and foolish law of 
the country, and its publisher and editor sub- 
jected to numerous prosecutions, the last of 
which resulted in the sentence of a heavy fine 
and imprisonment ; the charge in this case was 
a libel on President Bonaparte, and the sen- 
tence was unjustly severe, even supposing the 
charge true. For a time Proudhon kept out of 
the way, in order to avoid imprisonment, but at 
last gave himself up, and was put in jail, where 
he now remains, and where, we hear, he is 
about to be married. His paper finally ceased 
to appear, together with the other democratic 
journals of Paris, after the affair of June 13, 
and has not since been recommenced. 
Proudhon was chosen from Paris to the 



10 PBOUDHON 

national assembly at the election held to fill 
vacancies June 4, 1848; he had 77,094 votes; 
the highest number of votes given to any can- 
didate was 126,889 for M. Moreau. In the 
assembly his course has been in harmony with 
his previous history. Never for an instant has 
he wavered from the side of the people, and 
never flinched before opposition, however over- 
powering and angry. Next to his devotion to 
the cause of liberty his chief merit is his perfect 
frankness. He has no concealments and no 
compromises, never attempts to pass for any- 
thing other than he is, has nothing to do with 
trick or management. Such as he sees the 
truth or the fact, so he proclaims it ; there are 
no shades and ambiguities of meaning in his 
vocabulary ; but what he has to say comes 
bluntly and roughly out. If yon agree with it, 
well ; if not, you will feel yourself outraged, 
perhaps, by the sweeping nature of the state- 
ment ; to the speaker, personally, it is a matter 
of little consequence which. 

M. Proudhon is about five feet eight inches 
high, of rather clumsy person. His hair is 
light, his complexion fresh, his eyes blue and

keen, and Lis nose slightly retroussee. His 
face expresses quickness, intelligence, and con- 
fidence. He is not an orator, though at some 
of the banquets he has been roused to real 
eloquence ; he gesticulates considerably, and 
without anything like grace. His voice is harsh 
and unmusical, and his speech distinct and 
monotonous. He uses no metaphors, never at- 
tempts any nights, but goes at his subject in a 
business-like fashion. When he speaks in the 
assembly, he always commands attention, and 
often raises a tempest. But the members never 
fail to cease their clamor in order that he may 
go on ; they know that they must hear him, 
and, besides, they are not unwilling to do so, 
for he never talks at random, says what nobody 
else would think of, and, when he is done, 
stops. In the tribune, as well as in the press, 
he is a man of great originality, complete fear- 
lessness, and of force ever new and active. 
The conservatives hate him, and fear him more 
than they hate ; they call him bad names ; they 
seek to destroy him. The people love him, not 
because he is a demagogue, but because he is 
true. He never seeks their favor, nor the favor 
of anybody, but says what he believes. 



•12 PROUDHOX 

This remarkable man lacks, however, in the 
practical wisdom which steers through diffi- 
culties without running ashore. He is no poli- 
tician, and has not the politician's tact and 
prudence. He is deficient in the love of ap- 
probation, and cares too little for others. This 
was especially manifested in the closing up of 
the Bank of the People last spring in Paris. 
The organization had been commenced by him 
in conjunction with Victor Chipron, Jules 
Lechevalier, Raman de la Sagra, and others ; 
but, when he came to be put in prison, he 
thought it necessary to close it up. Accord- 
ingly he himself reimbursed all the subscribers, 
taking upon his own shoulders the whole ex- 
penses and the loss of stopping. But at the 
same time he published a statement which was 
not only uncourteous . but positively unkind, 
towards his former associates, whom he, in 
fact, charged with stupidity and unfairness. 
This act lost him many friends, and exhibits 
the weak side of his character.* 

* There are two sides to this. It is necessary to 
read only Proudhon's defence of his course, to be 
found in his collected miscellaneous writings, to see 
that in the main he acted properly. — Publisher's Note. 



PROUDIION 13 

Great as is the influence Proud lion's books 
have exercised upon opinion in France, it is as 
a journalist that he has come most in contact 
with the people. His paper had a very large 
circulation ; at one time its .daily sale was sixty 
thousand. This was due to him alone, for 
none of his associates had the talent to gain 
so wide a circle of readers. The style of his ar- 
ticles could not but arrest the attention of the 
most indiffefent reader, while to the aroused 
minds of the masses they were like trumpet- 
blasts in the great battle of the Rich and the 
Poor. We remember particularly one of his 
leaders, under the title of " The Malthusians," 
which sold fifty thousand extra copies of the 
paper, it being reprinted the next day to meet 
the demand. In it he showed how all society 
was based on the doctrine of the celebrated 
Englishman, and how statesmen, philosophers, 
priests, writers, all taught that there were too 
many human beings on the earth, that the 
great banq uet of nature was not spread for all, 
and she had no word for the surplus except the 
command to depart. He showed that there 
were, in reality, but two parties in the contest 



14 PROUDHON 

of opinion, -^-the Malthusians and .the Social- 
ists. It was such an article as a strong man 
might write after having let the world's spec- 
tacle of misery and wrong sink into his soul. 
Such indignation, such massive sarcasm, such a 
stern lighting- up of all the deformities of that 
vast scheme of plundering the many by the 
few, we call society ! That was a rare article 
even for Proudhon, but he always wrote with 
surpassing ability, though often with utter lack 
of judgment. His attack on Louis Napoleon, 
which got him in prison, was an instance of 
this. It did no adequate good, and deprived 
him of liberty. The thing might have been 
done less quixotically. There was no question 
of principle so involved in it as to leave no 
choice. Had there been, we should call the af- 
fair anything but quixotic. 

But, after all, M. Proudhon is one of the 
most noteworthy men of the present French 
nation, admitting that he has all the faults you 
please. He is, or is said to be, paradoxical, 
belligerent, destructive, eccentric, revolution- 
ary, agrarian, infidel, and we know not what 
else. Such are the accusations leveled against 



PEOUDHON 15 

him most zealously indeed, by the privileged 
classes whose privileges he never spares. We 
do not now inquire whether these charges are 
just or unjust. For the present let us judge 
the man by his usefulness ; and in this view it 
is not too much to say he is a man whom the 
age could not do without. No single man has 
done so much as he to prevent France from 
lapsing into the stagnation of decay, and with 
France all Europe. Moreover, it is well to 
bear in mind two things, — namely, that such a 
contest as is now up in the old world cannot be 
settled by soft words, but by harsh words that 
cut through old things like the jagged light- 
ning ; and also that such a man as he does not 
receive justice from his own generation. 

One thing must not be omitted before clos- 
ing our article. The personal character of 
Proudhon is above reproach ; his practical 
morals are a thousand times more worthy of 
commendation than those of many men whose 
praise is in the mouth of every u moderate and 
honest " conservative.

II.* 

Whoever seeks in Proudhon's books for a 
complete system will be disappointed. 
Hitherto his writings have been critical more 
than constructive. They bristle with ideas 
and suggestions, like a wheat-field with bearded 
heads ; learning, wit, logic, all are there, and 
occasionally an imagination equally massive 
and glowing surprises you with its displays. 
He appeals for the most part to the judgment 
of his readers, aiming to convince the under- 
standing, not to influence the feelings. No 
man has more at heart the elevation of the 
working classes to that position of dignity and 
honor which belongs to their office in the social 
mechanism ; none has a keener sense of the 
wrong under which they have suffered from the 
time that Labor, wearing the fetters and re- 
ceiving the stripes of a slave, first commenced 
the dreary process of sowing that others might 
be fed, building that others might inhabit, 
spinning and weaving that others might be

clothed/ But his books contain no arguments 
addressed to the benevolence of his readers ; 
hardly any aimed at their sense of justice. 
He deals with principles and demonstrations, 
things of the pure intellect, and generally more 
by negative than positive statements. For the 
moment he divests himself of all faculties but 
the logical, and lets nothing pass because it is 
good or beautiful or universally revered, but 
stands before it implacably demanding : Can 
this be proved ? When he became a journalist, 
treating current political topics, he of course 
changed this method. His paper is con- 
sequently made more readable than his books. 
His three principal works, whose titles are 
" The Creation of Order in Humanity," 
" Property," and "Economical Contradic- 
tions," aspire to the rank of science, passion- 
less and impersonal. They abound in evidences 
of the former philosophical studies of their 
author, some of them brilliant in their compact 
lucidity, as, for instance, the analysis of the 
great German philosophers which goes before 
the essay on Property in the " Contradictions." 
It would be difficult to find a more striking 



18 • PROUDHOK 

statement of the kind ; it makes what is obscure 
in itself both intelligible and interesting. 

But what most arrests the attention of the 
hasty reader is the hand, always bold and often 
irreverent, laid upon what is usually regarded 
beyond question. Proudhon seems at times as 
if possessed by the spirit of denial and contra- 
diction, like a special incarnation of Hegel's 
" immanent negativity." Hence the accusation 
of atheism, — a charge which we could easily 
confirm by the quotation of isolated passages 
or refute by the quotation of others. But such 
passages belong together with others, and 
neither those one side nor the other would, if 
quoted alone, convey a just idea of their author 
even as a theologian, — a function which he 
might have omitted attempting without loss of 
fame. How he came to attempt it is no con- 
cern of ours just at this time. We have now 
nothing to do with M. Proudhon's transcen- 
dental speculations ; our business is to try and 
get at his political economy. 

As we said, he has not published any com- 
plete system, but his views on important ques- 
tions may be gleaned without much difficulty 
here and there. 




/ 

&lt; I 



PROUDHON 19 

His fundamental principle is the Equality of hMbtrf 
Functions. All branches of labor are, he main- 
tains, of the same essential value. We quote 
from the " Creation de l'Ordre dans 
THumanite " : 

" What is the comparative measure of 
values ? In other terms, what is for every pro- 
ducer the natural price of the thing he desires 
to sell relatively to that he desires to buy ? 

" A. Smith replies: * The price of each thing 
is the labor requisite for its production. Ac- 
cordingly two laborers, by reciprocally estimat- 
ing their labor, may always find the com- 
parative measure of their products, whatever 
the value of the articles which they propose to 
exchange.' 

" The error of Smith and those who have 
followed him is to think that economy becomes 
more and more remote from its abstract prin- 
ciples as civilization advances ; instead of 
which it is the organic development of Society 
which renders the application of these principles 
possible. Yes, the price of everything is the 
labor necessary to produce it ; and, since each 
laborer is individually paid by his own pro- 



20 PBOUDHON 

duct, the product of one ought also to be able 
to pay the labor of another ; the only difficulty 
is to find a comparative measure of values. It 
will not do to say with Smith : This measure 
might exist in the savage state, but can be 
found no longer. Rather let us say : Labor 
can be equitably valued neither in the bar- 
barous state nor during the ascending period of 
civilization, nor while there exist those whom 
pride makes lazy, men incapable through here- 
ditary vice, knaves from intemperance of any 
sort, traders not controlled by the community ; 
but the time will surely arrive." 

This does not mean that every laborer should 
share equally with all others, which is the doc- 
trine of a school of Communists ; no man less 
liable to the charge of Communism than 
Proudhon. lie proposes no such arbitrary 
equality. He means that the labor of a shoe- 
maker, for example, is as valuable in itself as 
that of a goldsmith, clerk, artist, physician, 
legislator, and that only the accidents of a 
transitional state of society cause one's work to 
be valued twice or ten times as high as an- 
other's, supposing them equal in talent and in- 



PROUDHON 21 

dustry in their respective employments. It is 
a sign of great imperfection in the social or- 
ganization, M. Proudhon would say, when a 
congressman gets eight dollars a day and a car- 
penter, who may be vastly superior in his pro- 
fession to the congressman in his, has to put up 
with ten and sixpence. This principle, it should 
not be forgotten, does not preclude the action 
of natural inequalities of capacity and assiduity, 
but merely gives them a basis of equality, in- 
equality being, as Proudhon holds, the law of 
nature always based on its opposite. 

This equality — a means, not an end, a mode, 
not a substance — is an ideal toward which So- 
ciety moves, but which it cannot at once attain. 
But what is the means of reaching it ? Asso- 
ciation. Here Proudhon agrees with the Social- 
ists generally. But he differs from them in the 
nature of his association and conditions neces- 
sary to its establishment. He differs from 
them all in retaining the separate household, 
without which, he says, he cannot conceive of 
woman as occupying a position worthy of so- 
ciety or of herself ; from some he differs in 
preserving the right of inheritances ; from the 



22 PROUDHON 

Communists in regard to their grand doctrine ; 
and from the disciples of Fourier by thinking 
no great things of Fourier's passional theory, as 
well as by denying that capital is productive 
or is entitled to any interest whatever. In- 
terest and rent are the illusions which he claims 
to have destroyed theoretically. He claims 
also to know how to destroy them practically 
without doing any damage to society, but the 
contrary. But what we have farther to say of 
his theory must be postponed to another oc- 
casion, when we will speak of money, credit, 
and property, and say a word concerning his 
famous adage, La proprietd c } est le vol. 



III.* 

We resume our statement of the economical 
principles of the great French Radical, and, in 
order to meet the curiosity of our readers, 
abandon the logical order of their development, 
and commence with the last and most startling 
of all his propositions : 

PROPERTY. 

'"* Property, de facto et dejure, is contradic- 



* " The Spirit of the A^e," November 24, 1849. 



PROUDHON 23 

tory in its nature, and this is the precise ground 
why it is an actual thing. 

"In fact, Property is the right of possession; 
at the same time it is the right of exclusion. 

"Property is the reward of labor; and at the 
same time the negation of labor. 

" Property is the immediate product of so- 
ciety ; and the dissolution of society. 

" Property is an institution of justice; and 
Property is Robbery. 

" From all this it follows that property will 
yet be transformed according to a positive, 
complete, social, and true idea ; whereby, the 
old institution of property being abolished, it 
will become equally real and beneficent for all. 
And the proof of this is, once again, that Prop- 
erty is a Contradiction." 

Here is the heresy in the very words of the 
author. It has produced an extensive commo- 
tion in the world, whether because it is an un- 
pardonable outrage upon some truth whereof 
the conservatives are special guardians, or be- 
cause it drags into the daylight and roughly 
handles some diseased spot in the social body 
which it is their care to hide, we do not pretend 



24 PROUDHOK 

to judge; as to that matter future generations 
will decide ; our business is simply to tell what 
Proudhon really says and means. 

None of the writers who have come up to the 
defence of Property as it is have stated more 
ably or clearly than he the necessity for the 
institution as the basis and condition of society ; 
none have more insisted on the service, which it 
has rendered to the progress of the human race. 
Whatever good can be said of it he says again 
and again. His books are a storehouse of ar- 
guments on that side of the question. 

But it is the characteristic of ideas and in- 
stitutions to pass through a state of contradic- 
tion, of affirmation and negation, of positive 
and negative, so to say ; and this law applies 
to the facts of political economy as well as to 
others. Proudhon was not the first to discover 
this ; common sense has always known it ; he is 
simply entitled to the credit of stating it with 
great force and distinctness, though, had he 
made use of a less plain and rude style of 
speech, he might have said all he has done with 
comparatively little disturbance. He was, 
however, born a revolutionist, and things have 



PROXJDHON 25 

nourished in him a revolutionary spirit, pos- 
sibly because the world had need of such a 
man. 

To illustrate this universal presence of the 
law of contradiction, or of opposites : The in- 
vention of machinery is an inestimable benefit 
to the community, including the laboring 
classes ; but, on the other hand, it throws work- 
men out of employment, renders their existence 
precarious, makes them wholly dependent upon 
the owners of the machines, and necessarily re- 
sults in pauperism. This is clear to the eyes 
of all who have eyes to open, and the percep- 
tion of it is the cause of the attempts that 
laborers make to destroy machines which, they 
think, will deprive them of work. What does 
this indicate ? That there should be no 
machinery, or that pauperism is a good of 
which we cannot have enough ? By no means. 
It indicates that things are in a state of discord 
or transition ; and, — to borrow an illustration 
from metaphysics, — just as the contradiction 
between free will and necessity shows that 
there is a higher philosophical truth and a more 
universal formula to be arrived at, which will 



26 PEOUDHON 

absorb and reconcile the two, so, in the contra- 
diction between the increase of the aggregate 
well-being by means of machinery and the cor- 
responding increase of misery by the same 
means, is there both the ground and the assur- 
ance of the establishment of some new and 
comprehensive social principle in which that 
antagonism will disappear. In other words, 
society will yet be so arranged that machinery 
will work for the equal good of parties, and 
not bring slavery and want to any. 

Now, the same contradiction must attach to 
property, and the adage of Proudhon merely 
states it in the strongest language. Yet those 
who speak of it omit half the proposition, and 
that the first half, c ' Property is an institution 
of justice," in order to dwell on the negative, 
" Property is Robbery." But, taking both 
clauses together, this is no more than to say: 
While the right of possession is founded in ab- 
solute justice, and without it society could not 
exist, in the present state of unrelated and 
hostile individual interests Property becomes an 
irresistible means, combining the elements of 
fraud and violence, of taking from the pro- 



PROUDHON 27 

ducers, or from those into whose hands the 
chances of the battle have flung them, the pro- 
ducts of labor without giving a fair equivalent, 
and quite as often without giving any equi- 
valent at all. Or, as Proudhon has it, Property- 
is Robbery. 

" But," exclaim in loud chorus the whole 
respectable world, — bankers, merchants, manu- 
facturers, and gentlemen of fortune, — c ' O base 
and dangerous Proudhon ! we are not robbers ; 
our consciences are clean ; we fulfil the law, 
gain legal gains, and plunder no man. Where- 
fore, then, stir up the ignorant and hungry 
masses, who, understanding not a jot of thy 
transcendental notions, thy laws of contradic- 
tion and what not, will apprehend only that 
our comfort and luxury are not fairly earned 
and their hunger and privation not fairly 
brought upon them, and will rush with blind 
and bloody fury to despoil us of what is ours, 
kill us, and turn our children destitute into the 
street ? Be silent with thy cry of ill omen, or 
we will proclaim thee a lunatic and a criminal, 
and put thee in prison while we have the 
power!" 



28 PROUDHON 

To such adjurations Proudhon has latterly re- 
plied with language of defiance and contempt, 
but in times past, when more gently entreated 
with, he has answered thus: "Friends, I do 
not accuse you personally ; it is only the social 
fact that I impeach. I doubt not that your 
consciences are clean, for you do no more than 
belongs to the institutions under which you 
were born and brought up. But that does not 
affect the fact. In Turkey, Carolina, and 
Louisiana, and some other equally benighted 
and unfortunate places, men think it no wrong 
to hold men as property ; their consciences are, 
perhaps, not hurt by it more than is a stone 
by the blow of a feather. But nevertheless the 
fact of property in men is robbery of a bad 
sort. So, too, that baron of the middle ages 
who descended from his castle to levy on the 
peasant of the plain, or to relieve the traveler 
of his surplus funds, suffered nothing in his 
tough and bold conscience, though now-a-days 
nobody hesitates to call his act by a hard name. 
And what shall we Ray of the acts done by the 
land speculator or the usurer who employs the 
power of capital to take advantage of others' 



PROUDHON 29 

necessities and get out of them the last cent ? 
Ah, gentlemen, it is not a good sign when you 
are disturbed by a word. Truth is truth, facts 
are facts, justice is justice ; let us talk plainly. 
Besides, do you not see that you have had it 
your way for some centuries ? It is high time 
for the other side of this great economical con- 
tradiction to be brought out, if the world is ever 
to arrive at a solution of it. Read my political 
economy with attention, and learn the philo- 
sophy of the matter, and make fools of your- 
selves no longer." 

The general idea of Proudhon in respect of 
property is nothing else than its regeneration, 
if we may venture to use that term. Until 
this is brought about, there must be both jus- 
tice and injustice in it ; on the one side, the 
necessary and perfectly true right of posses- 
sion and enjoyment of the product of our own 
labor and the gifts of friends ; and, on the 
other side, the plunder of producers and pos- 
sessors by the rent of land, — in which, as well 
as in other gifts of nature, he holds no man 
can justly have absolute and exclusive property, 
— by fraud, gaming, speculation, tricks of 



30 PROUDHON 

trade, usury, interest, etc., etc. We conclude 
this subject with a paragraph translated from 
the " Contradictions Economiques ": 

" Thus property is formed as a matter of 
convention, which differs as much from justice 
as eclecticism does from truth, or the real value 
of a thing does from its market price. In the 
series of variations which it undergoes between 
the two extremities of injustice, — namely, rude 
violence and faithless cunning, — the contend- 
ing parties continually end by some convention. 
But justice follows upon their agreement and 
compels the fulfilment of its conditions ; the 
true law continually evolves itself from the 
sophistical and arbitrary law, and reform is 
accomplished through the conflict between in- 
telligence and power. This immense move- 
ment, which has its starting-point in the ob- 
scurity of savage life and its ending on the day 
when society rises to the synthetic idea of Pos- 
session and of Value, and this mass of changes 
and of overturn ings brought about by the social 
instinct and perpetually seeking their scientific 
and definite solution,- are what I name the reli- 
gion of property." 



PBOITDHON 31 

Does this " synthetic idea" mean Commun- 
ism ? No, says our author ; it means Re- 
ciprocity, Association. 

LABOR AND CAPITAL. 

Labor is productive ; capital is not. 

Labor produces capital and consumes it ; cap- 
ital produces nothing. 

The laborer without capital would soon sup- 
ply his wants by its production, for the earth 
and its energies are for his use, the sun shines 
to aid his toil, the air gives vitality to his corn 
and vines, the rain brings forward the harvest, 
and nature, which has created the sheep, the 
cow, and the horse for his service, has a thou- 
sand hidden forces to be employed by the in- 
ventions of his brain ; but capital with no 
laborers to consume it can only lie useless and 
rot back into the first elements of matter. 

But, you say, the laborer with capital pro- 
duces more than one without. Therefore cap- 
ital is productive as the tool and instrument of 
labor, and I, its owner, am, in strict and ab- 
solute justice, entitled to some share of this 
larger product which the laborer has realized by 
its aid. 



32 PBOUDHON 

Not so, Friend ! Your capital has in itself 
still produced nothing; it has simply enabled 
the laborer to derive a greater aid from those 
powers of nature which are free to all men and 
are ever ready to help industry ; it is thus that 
the product has been increased, and not because 
your wheat, or wool, or iron, or steel, or the 
labor heretofore incorporated with them have 
created anything. Nature and active labor 
produce ; the remains of past labor, called 
capital, are only capable of being consumed. 
If the laborer has used anything of yours, let 
him give you an equivalent therefor; justice de- 
mands nothing more. 

Perhaps you answer that, if the laborer will 
not give you more than an equivalent, he shall 
not have your capital to use, and may see how 
he will do without it. 

That is another matter. We were not speak- 
ing of your wishes or of his necessities. It may 
be better for him to give you an enormous 
share of his product rather than be deprived of 
using your surplus ; but that has nothing to do 
with strict justice, and by no means proves that 
your capital or anybody's else is productive, as 



PROUDHON 33 

we will show you when Labor and Credit and 
Exchanges — or, iu other words, Production, 
Circulation, and Consumption — are once rightly 
organized. 

Well, if this be so, what then ? 

Why, interest and rent are not founded in 
any permanent principle, but merely arise from 
temporary necessities. By and by men will pay 
and receive no more of them. 



IV.* 

We trust no man will do M. Proudhon the 
injustice to suppose that his labor and capital 
ideas are all condensed into the brief statement 
which closed our last article. In that we rather 
aimed to present the essence of the question 
than to develop an entire doctrine, or even to 
hint at any other than the main point of the 
general argument. By the way, we do not re- 
member to have seen this presented in any 
chapter or passage of our author's writings, and 
justice to him requires it to be stated. Did 
space or time permit us to treat the entire sub-

ject thoroughly, we should have taken it up 
under several distinct heads, — namely: capital 
is essentially unproductive, and therefore rent 
and interest are robbery ; rent and interest 
violate the law of fraternity, and cannot do 
otherwise; the natural increase of wealth tends 
to their diminution and ultimate disappearance, 
as is evident from history. They may and will 
be done away with by the organization of mu- 
tual credit, and therefore are intrinsically false. 

CREDIT. 

What is credit ? 

It is a sort of corollary to the exchange of 
products, or a kind of second stage of that pro- 
cess. A has a bushel of wheat which he does 
not need and which B does, but B has nothing 
at present to give in exchange for it. A lets 
him have it, and receives his promise to deliver 
an equivalent at some future time, when he 
shall have produced it. Such is the operation 
t&gt;f credit, w T hich arose soon after the first com- 
mencement of exchanges. Presently it assumed 
a new feature, which may be illustrated thus : 
B needs A's bushel of wheat and has an article 
produced by himself, but cannot divide it so 



PROUDHON 35 



as to render an equivalent, or does not wish to 
dispose of it at present,, and accordingly takes 
the wheat on credit. Thus credit is the giving 
of one product in consideration of the future 
return of another yet to be produced, or which 
is already produced, but not on the spot or in 
a condition which will allow it to be delivered. 
The uses and advantages of this operation are 
well known, and need no explanation. 

All credit presupposes labor, and, if labor 
were to cease, credit would be impossible. 

What, then, is the legitimate source of 
credit ? Who ought to control it ? And for 
whose benefit should it most directly be used ? 

The laboring classes. 

But, instead of credit being governed by the 
producers in a nation, it is always in the hands 
of the intermediaries, the exchangers and 
agents of circulation ; and, instead of being 
used to aid the workers, it is generally used to 
make money, — i. €., to get the greatest pos- 
sible amount of the products of labor for the 
least return, and, if possible, for none at all. 
And it is manifest that, if the working classes 
could once gain possession of this great in- 
strument, which rightfully belongs to them, 



X 



36 PROTTDHON 

they might escape from the necessity of work- 
ing for others, or, in other words, of giving the 
larger part of their products for the use of 
capital ; they might become the owners of the 
tools they use, become emancipated from the 
domination exercised over them by their agents 
and public servants, set up for themselves, and 
enjoy the fruit of their industry. 

But how can they gain possession of this 
instrument ? 

By the organization of credit, on the princi- 
ple of reciprocity or mutualism, if we may use 
a new word. In such an organization credit is 
raised to the dignity of a social function, 
managed by the community; and, as society 
never speculates upon its members, it will lend 
its credit, not as our banks do theirs, so as to 
make seven per cent, or more out of the bor- 
rowers, but at the actual cost of the transac- 
tion. A practical illustration of the above- 
named principle in a similar matter may be 
found in the system of mutual insurance. 

MONEY. 

* 

The precious metals have an intrinsic value, 
which grows out of their uses in the arts, and 



PROUDHOltf 37 

another value as the representative of other pro- 
ducts. It is only in their latter capacity that 
they are called money. Their use in that 
capacity is easy to account for. Their compact- 
ness and indestructibility naturally led the 
world to fix on them for such a purpose. 

But, as the aggregate of products and of ex- 
changes enlarged, it was found that gold and 
silver were inadequate for the transaction of 
business, and the social genius produced the bill 
of* exchange and the bank-note. This was a 
great invention, whose benefits are not gen- 
erally understood, whereby commerce and, con- 
sequently, both production and consumption 
were vastly increased, and with them human 
well-being. 

Still, though a new sort of representative 
was apparently introduced, in reality there was 
no change. The bill of exchange was and is 
only a species of shadow, the representation of 
a representative, gold and silver remaining as 
the actual medium of circulation. 

The difficulties which belong to the use of 
gold and silver as money are these : 

1. They are articles of commerce as well as 



38 PROUDUON 

representatives, whereas a representative of 
values should have no other character, and be 
useful for no other purpose. 

2. The quantity of gold and silver not be- 
ing proportioned to the amount of products to 
be represented and put into circulation, while at 
the same time the circulation cannot be per- 
formed without them, it follows that whoever 
can get control of the specie of the world can 
rule the markets with despotic hand, and may- 
work his will upon communities and nations ; 
and also that such a monopoly of the circulat- 
ing medium can be effected with an ease almost 
infinitely greater than a monopoly of any 
other article of general use. And thus specie 
money, from being a convenient medium of cir- 
culation, has become the tyrant of both the 
production and the consumption of the world. 

3. By means of this tyranny labor is. kept in 
subjection ; financial speculations, stock- 
jobbing, and usury are perpetrated ; and inter- 
est is maintained at a ruinous rate in every 
country. Destroy it, and a monopoly even 
more unjust and pernicious than the monopoly 
of the soil — that other great outrage upon na- 



PROUDHON 39 

tural justice — is destroyed, and society is re- 
lieved of scores of parasites, who go back to 
useful occupations, since they are no longer 
able to live upon the industry of others. 

The question then arises whether any other 
basis than gold or silver can be found for the 
circulation. M. Proudhon says yes. 

. Gold and silver feed and clothe and shelter 
no man ; they are good to the mass of people 
merely because they can be exchanged for food 
and clothing and shelter. If we, then, can dis- 
cover anything which shall be equally or more 
portable, equally certain of being everywhere 
received in exchange for all products, and at 
the same time safe from being monopolized, we 
shall accomplish a great good, and the precious 
metals may be dispensed with except for their 
original uses. Is such a circulating medium 
possible in connection with such a system of 
credit as that of which we have above given the 
general features ? In other words, can Pro- 
duction, Circulation, and Consumption be or- 
ganized upon the principle of Mutualism, Re- 
ciprocity, Solidarity ? 

M. Proudhon's answer to this question will 



40 PROUDHON 

be found in our article in which we describe the 
Bank of the People. 



V.* 

We have stated some of the main points of 
Proudhon's political economy to be : 

1. Equality of functions, or of different 
employments. 

2. Non-productivity of capital. 

3. Mutualism of credit, or credit at cost. 
In his pamphlets and in the earlier numbers 

of his paper he gives the name of Bank of Ex- 
change to the practical institution by which he 
proposes to realize the idea of credit at cost, 
or, as he expresses it, mutual and gratuitous 
credit. 

That idea is original with him, though some 
of the other schools claim to have the hint of it 
in their systems ; but he is the man who first 
conceived and developed it positively and 
clearly, which is what constitutes an original 

invention. An institution actually carrying it

out with success, and loaning money, every- 
where current, not at a high rate of interest, 
but at the actually trifling cost of transacting 
its business operations and covering contin- 
gencies, would afford the most conclusive proof 
of the non-productivity of capital ; that is to 
say, it would prevent rents from rising above 
the mere cost of keeping the premises rented in 
repair, and would totally abolish usury and 
interest; for, if a man can borrow, without in- 
terest, the notes of a bank which are of uni- 
versal currency and perfectly guaranteed, he 
will not go to his neighbor and ask credit of 
him with interest, nor hire his land or his 
house at any more than it may cost to preserve 
the same in good condition ; and thus, rent and 
interest being done away, where remains any 
productivity of capital ? People will then not 
accumulate wealth as they do now in order to 
lend at interest, that they may enjoy the fruit 
of others' toil, themselves doing nothing, but 
the products of labor, no longer hoarded by the 
few, will be exchanged and enjoyed by the 
many ; and everywhere new wants in the 
masses will give a new stimulus to productive 



42 PROUDHON 

industry, which will thrive accordingly to an 
extent of which, in the present state of mono- 
poly, we have no conception, and there will be 
universal abundance and satisfaction ; and 
then whoever wishes to enjoy must labor there- 
fore in some useful vocation, as music, litera- 
ture, or blacksmithing, or carpentry, or some 
other. And so there will at last be gained an 
equilibrium of values, or just relation of differ- 
ent branches of labor to each other ; or, in 
other words, the equality of functions will be 
established, and the trades of shoemaker, gov- 
ernor, artist, farmer, etc., be equally remun- 
erated, and that not by arbitrary enactment, 
but by the natural tendency and effect of the 
laws which rule in political economy as well as 
elsewhere. Such are the ideas of Proudhon. 
Their final expression is the institution of 
mutual credit, whose members — and it should 
include the whole productive part of the com- 
munity — combine to lend each other the credit 
of the institution at cost, just as the members 
of a mutual insurance company combine to af- 
ford each other at cost the guaranty of the 
company against loss of property by fire or 



PEOUDHON 43 

otherwise. The principle is precisely the same 
in both cases. 

The Bank of Exchange is composed of men 
engaged in productive labor, who, feeling the 
abases attached to the fiction which makes gold 
and silver the basis of the circulation, associate 
themselves together to restore the real basis, — 
namely, consumable products ; and, feeling the 
evils which result from the monopoly of credit 
in the hands of the non-producing class, they 
determine to abolish the same. 

The institution of mutual credit has two 
phases : the one is during the time of its forma- 
tion, before the whole body of producers is 
completed. In the former gold and silver are 
required for partial use ; in the latter they are 
dispensed with.* 

Let us suppose a community in which are 



* It must not be inferred from this that Proudhon 
expected to dispense with a standard of value. He 
did contemplate, however, the gradual disappearance 
of gold and silver as actual circulating media, and his 
fundamental financial principle is the use of all pro- 
ducts of stable value (including gold and silver) on an 
equal footing as security for currency. — Publi87ier &gt; 8 
Note. 



44 PROUDHON 

men pursuing all branches of useful industry — 
and by the word useful we mean to include the 
fine arts with the trades producing articles of 
luxury and elegance — whatever beautifies as 
well as what supports life — farmers, mechanics, 
manufacturers, housekeepers, schoolmasters, 
artists. They form an institution of mutual 
credit, or Bank of Exchange ; it issues its 
notes, loaning them to A, B, and C as they are 
wanted and as security is given. Every man 
in the community belongs to the bank, and is 
bound to receive the notes in exchange for 
whatever he has to dispose of. They are, in 
fact, payable at the farm or the workshop of 
every one of the members, not in gold and sil- 
ver, but in consumable products; and indeed 
they are not bank-notes, but bills of exchange, 
drawn, so to say, on every member of the 
bank, and bearing the signatures of every other. 
They are true representatives, since they stand 
directly for articles of use. And, as the bank 
is formed by the whole community, not for 
the especial advantage of any individual or 
class, but for the mutual benefit of all, of 
course no interest is exacted on loans, except 



PEOUDHON 45 

enough to cover risks and expenses. Thus, 
while every man is left free to follow his own 
productive business in his own way, and the 
principle of individual liberty suffers no diminu- 
tion, there is a complete reciprocity established 
throughout. 

The point where a true reform of society 
must commence is the function of exchanges, 
for that is the point where economical relations 
converge. By introducing mutualism into ex- 
changes and credit we introduce it everywhere, 
and labor will assume a new aspect and become 
truly democratic. Thus the problem of the 
present times will be solved, and the republic 
of wealth appear, completing the circle of the 
Revolution. 

" The republic of wealth," asks, perhaps, 
some anxious conservative, " what is that ? the 
equal division of the goods of the world among 
all its inhabitants ? the robbing of the few for 
the many ? " Not so, replies our author, O man 
of much respectability but of little brains, 
talking of robbing, when thy hoards are filled 
with riches gotten at the corn mart and the 
stock exchange ! But, as the Revolution has 



46 PEOUDHON 

destroyed the tyranny of the Church and the 
tyranny of the State (though just now some of 
our French addle-pates are seeking to resus- 
citate them, especially the latter), so it must de- 
stroy the tyranny of capital, — that is, of pro- 
perty. We have established, more or less 
thoroughly, equality before the divine law, 
which is the republic in matters of religion ; 
equality before human law, which is the repub- 
lic in matters political ; now let us have equal- 
ity before fortune, which is the republic in 
matters of industry and enjoyment ; equal op- 
portunities of producing, equal protection in en- 
joying, and no more luxury to which useful 
labor has not established a right. " That is a 
hard saying," says the questioner, and goes his 
way. 

The Bank of Exchange implies, then, the 
combination of the whole producing commun- 
ity for the purpose of mutual credit and the 
establishment of a sound medium of exchange, 
or, as we say, of circulation. We trust our 
explanation of this conception of mutualism of 
credit, hasty as it has been, has been sufficient 
to make our readers understand it. To our

thinking it is a grand and fruitful idea, — in- 
deed, the great idea of modern economical sci- 
ence. Some may cavil, and that with just 
ground, at the details of the organization which 
we have hinted at rather than described, but 
we shall reckon him but a bold sophist who, 
with any comprehansion of the principle, will 
presume to assail it. 

But how shall this bank be established in our 
present world as it is in Paris, for instance ? 
There are two ways, says Proudhon. The 
better way is for the government to do it ; let it 
take the Bank of France, repaying its stock- 
holders, and convert it into the Bank of Ex- 
change, the notes being a legal tender as they 
now are.* Let the rate of interest be reduced, 
but yet kept sufficiently high to meet the ex- 
penses of the government, thereby dispensing 
with the whole business of tax-assessing and 

* Proudhon never favored mutual banking through 
the State save as a measure of transition and expe- 
diency. And even in that aspect he came later to dis- 
approve it, relying on private initiative and free com- 
petition for the realization of his views. As a believer 
in the abolition of the State, government banking was 
necessarily objectionable to him. — Publisher's Note, 



48 PROTJDHON 

tax-gathering ; two or three per cent, would be 
enough to do that at the beginning, and there- 
after still farther reductions might be made ; 
the revenue would then be collected more surely 
and without its being felt by the payers ; all 
branches of industry now languishing because 
the gold and silver that formed the basis of the 
circulation had been withdrawn and hidden 
through fear of the revolution by those who 
controlled them would be revived by suitable 
loans ; neither honest labor, nor the State, need 
then ever again to fall into the clutches of the 
usurers ; and, instead of passing through a 
period of depression, want of employment and 
of bread among the working classes, with ruin- 
ous experiments of national workshops and in- 
surrections and bloodshed, followed by a power- 
ful reaction against the new institutions of the 
country, the republic could at once have en- 
tered upon a career of active industry, prosper- 
ity, peace, and progress. 

To all this and much more like it but one 
reply could be made, — namely, assignats, irre- 
deemable paper money, speculation, expansive 
bankruptcy ; as though France were not already 



PBOUDHON 49 

in the premonitory pangs of bankruptcy and 
requiring some heroic operation to prevent 
dissolution. 

Well, continues our economist, if you will 
not allow the State, which, after all, is nothing 
but the community taken collectively, to un- 
dertake this reform, we must begin at the other 
end. We must appeal to individuals, and, if 
possible, bring together a sufficient body to un- 
dertake the work. 

In the summer of 1848 Proudhon was con- 
stantly occupied with the discussions of the as- 
sembly, and, though his paper constantly put 
forward his economical theories, in one form or 
another, nothing was done toward making a 
practical experiment of mutual credit. 
Through the spring he had daily published an 
appeal to those who desired to engage in estab- 
lishing the Bank of Exchange, but it was not 
productive of any actual result. 

Early in the autumn Jules Lechevalier, who 
is already somewhat known to American Social- 
ists, came to these conclusions : 

1. The principle of mutual credit is true; 

8. But it is impossible to introduce mutual- 



50 PROUDHON 

ism into the function of circulation without 
organizing both production and consumption on 
the same basis. Labor and commerce must be 
reformed by means of association as well as 
banking ; 

3. Because, rf labor be not organized, the 
laborers will be made to toil for others to re- 
ceive the fruit thereof as heretofore ; and, if 
commerce be not organized, the consumers will 
be imposed on and defrauded by the agents of 
exchange as heretofore ; and, moreover, the 
circulating medium, no matter what its basis, 
will be liable to be monopolized and to become 
an instrument of oppression as heretofore, caus- 
ing great wrongs and calamities; 

4. Therefore let us found an institution hav- 
ing three divisions, — namely, the Association 
for Mutual Credit, the Syndicate of Produc- 
tion, and the Syndicate of Consumption; and 
to the whole we will give the name of the 
Bank of the People. 

Proudhon is a man weakly jealous in respect 
of what he considers his intellectual offspring, 
and will not readily accept any other doctrine 
in connection with his own. He was invited to 



PROUDHON 51 

the meeting of the Workmen's Association 
called to consider this new plan, and came. M. 
Lechevalier opened the discussion with a state- 
ment of his views as lucid as it was modest 
and appropriate, attributing to Proudhon all 
that was original in the design and nominating 
him as chairman. From that time the enter- 
prise, with Proudhon at its head, was steadily 
carried forward, many other men of talent, 
such as Ramon de la Sagra and Victor Chipron, 
a workman possessing one of the clearest and 
most intelligent heads in Paris, participating in 
it, till the condemnation of Proudhon for a libel 
on President Bonaparte caused him to end his 
connection with the project and repay the sub- 
scription which had been made toward its 
realization. 

In his letter announcing this determination, 
published in the " Peuple" of April 12, 1849, 
he betrays a weak and ungenerous distrust of 
his associates, together with a jealousy of 
what they had added to his theory.* It has 



* See foot note on page 12. Proudhon consented to 
embody the Syndicates of Production and Consump- 
tion in the project of the Bank of the People simply 



52 PROUDHON 

been said that he also defrauded the subscribers 
to the Bank of the People. That is a false- 
hood. He insisted on paying them all, — him- 
self, from his private resources, bearing all ex- 
penses, in which was included a year's rent of 
the office of the Bank, with fixtures, books, 
etc. , complete for carrying on its business. 

The plan was afterwards resumed by Leche- 
valier, Chipron, and others under a form some- 
what modified, and with the support of the 
Democratic party and the workmen of Paris 
and other large cities of France, but nothing 
was ever accomplished, and finally the affair of 
June 13, 1849, dispersed the leaders and ended 



to humor those of his associates who placed stress on 
these features. He did not consider them of any 
value, — in fact, he looked upon them as surplusage, — 
but he knew that they could do no harm while he was 
at the head of the firm of P. J. Proudhon &amp; Co., the 
legal name of the Bank of the People. When, because 
of his imprisonment, he was unable longer to exercise 
an active control, he preferred to wind up the concern 
rather than see it come to grief in the hands of his as- 
sociates, who, however worthy personally, were not, as 
he was, practically and thoroughly versed in business 
and finance. In this decision he showed sound judg- 
ment. — PMisher's Note

the undertaking. In our next article we will 
give a thorough account of the organization 
and arrangements of the proposed institution. 
It is worthy of study, not only as an illustration 
of some of the profoundest principles of social 
economy, but as a chapter in the history of the 
times. 



VI.* 

The purpose of the Bank of the People is, as 
we have seen, the emancipation of labor and 
the consequent establishment of the republic of 
wealth. To accomplish this it organizes in- 
dustry, banking, and commerce, or, as the 
economists would say, Production, Circulation, 
and Consumption, on the threefold principle of 
Liberty, Equality, and Reciprocity. . We will 
take up these three functions separately, treat- 
ing, for the sake of convenience, the first and 
third before the second. 

THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY. THE SYN- 
DICATE OP PRODUCTION. 

There are in Paris some 150,000 workmen, 
a third or half of whom are already organized 

* "The Spirit of the Age," December 1, 1849. 



54 PROUDHON 

in associations for the prosecution of their vari- 
ous trades. Their progress has been most en- 
couraging, proving in a very conclusive way 
that the workmen of Paris not only possess 
much skill in practical affairs, but that labor, 
which, with the help of nature, has produced 
all the wealth there is in the world, is abun- 
dantly sufficient to its own emancipation, pro- 
vided there be unity of purpose and wisdom of 
direction among the laborers. 

Now, important as are these associations, it 
is manifest that the work is but half done when • 
they are formed and successfully in operation. 
They do, indeed, to a great extent abolish the 
exploitation of the employed worker by the 
employing capitalist, and make the worker his 
own employer ; but, in order to completely gain 
that end, the associations must be associated, 
united in one body for mutual aid, protection, 
and guidance, and for the increase of the com- 
mon force. It is the business of the Syndicate 
of Production to establish such a union, and 
draw forth all its advantages. 

The Syndicate of Production is a sort of cen- 
tral committee, or board of directors, chosen by 



PROUDHOX 55 

the various bodies of workmen to represent and 
take care of the interests of the producing class. 
Its duty to complete the organization in one 
body, which shall be governed according to 
universal suffrage, of all that class, whether 
now members of associations, carrying on busi- 
ness as employers, or laboring each for him- 
self ; to favor and assist the formation of in- 
dustrial associations ; to negotiate and guarantee 
what loans such associations may need of the 
Bank; to serve as a central point and agency of 
relations and intercourse between different 
branches of work; to supervise the quality of 
the articles produced ; to organize and direct 
among the various trades and associations a 
system of mutual insurance against all kinds of 
losses whose value can be estimated ; to en- 
courage inventions and improvements ; to pro- 
cure on the best terms the right of using in- 
ventions ; to guard against suffering on the part 
of those whose occupations are superseded by 
the introduction of new machines and pro- 
cesses ; to organize apprenticeship, so that the 
youth may be enabled, as far as possible, to 
learn a trade suited to his or her natural apti- 



56 PROUDHON 

tudes, and so that each corporation in need of 
apprentices may have them ; to organize a cen- 
tral fund for pensions to superannuated work- 
men ; to seek for a mode of so combining dif- 
ferent occupations as to avoid evils arising from 
the necessary suspension of certain trades dur- 
ing parts of the year ; to obviate the bad effects 
which the extreme division of labor has upon 
the workmen, etc. 

In a word, the producers being organized in 
one body, the Syndicate of Production is the 
provident head and executive hand thereof. 

THE ORGANIZATION OP COMMERCE. THE SYN- 
DICATE OP CONSUMPTION. 

It is a notorious fact that working people and 
poor people pay dearer for the necessaries of 
life than any class beside. Other persons can 
take advantage of favorable states of the mar- 
kets, buy in large quantities and of the best 
dealers ; but laborers, having nothing before 
hand, receiving small wages, and of necessity 
living from hand to mouth, can do none of 
these things. They buy the poorest and most 
adulterated articles of the most unconscionable 



PBOUDHON 57 

retailers, at times when prices are high, as well 

• 

as when they are low, and always at rates 
whose enormity is proportioned to the smallness 
of the quantity which they purchase at once. 
They pay in proportion far more for rents, fuel, 
lights, clothing, and food than those who lie 
in perfumed chambers, whose meats are fat, 
whose drink is red and sparkling, and whose 
vesture is sumptuous and soft. On the poor 
the abuses of the prevailing system of com- 
merce, everywhere bad enough, work their ut- 
most mischief. This must be remedied, 

We have already seen the producers com- 
bined for the function of production or in 
labor ; the matter now in hand is to combine 
them for the supply of their wants. The Syn- 
dicate of Consumption is designed to perform 
that office. 

It will procure the erection of great combined 
houses where there will be excellent and healthy 
accommodations for families and for single 
persons at low rents ; it will establish bakeries, 
meat markets, fruit shops, groceries, and will 
open in Paris and elsewhere magazines, and 
will buy at wholesale in the best markets and on 



58 PROUDHON 

the best terms all articles of necessity, and 
will also receive the same on consignment, tak- 
ing care that they shall be unadulterated and 
good, and will furnish them at cost, adding 
enough to cover expenses and risks, to those who 
come to buy them with the notes of the Hank, 
but not to those who come with specie money. 
And all other articles, not of common necessity, 
it will procure and deliver to order on the same 
terms. 

It will establish depots for the deposit of all 
kinds of materials for all trades, receiving them 
on consignment and selling them on commission ; 
and will make arrangements by which it will 
be able to supply whatever of that sort may 
from time to time be wanted ; and such articles 
it will also, in all cases, furnish on better terms 
on payment in the notes of the Bank than 
otherwise. 

It will open accounts with the different as- 
sociations and with the Syndicate of Production 
for such materials furnished for manufacture, 
and will also make advances of materials to the 
Syndicate of Production on consignments of 
manufactured articles, and in union with that 



PROUDHON 59 

board will exercise a supervision over the quali- 
ity and the price of products. 

In a word, it will labor to produce the most 
direct relations possible between the producer 
and the consumer, and to free both from the im- 
position of a vast horde of irresponsible inter- 
mediaries, whose constant aim is to buy for 
what costs 10 to produce, and sell it again for 
20 — with nothing but the insufficient check of 
competition to save both producer and con- 
sumer from being exorbitantly fleeced by every 
transaction. The Syndicate of Consumption 
will interpose a new check, though of course 
they will not attempt to overrule the law of 
supply and demand, and competition will still 
have a good chance to do what good it can. 
But what is obvious is that, under such an ar- 
rangement as that we have described, the as- 
sociations of workmen are secured the home 
market. They get the custom of the whole 
body of their brethren, which is no small thing; 
others will also buy of them, because they will 
sell good articles cheap. 

Let these things once get fairly at work, and 
what becomes of the world ? It is transformed. 



60 PROUDHON 

And for misery there is abundance, and for 
want satisfaction, and for ignorance intel- 
ligence, and for fraud uprightness, and for war 
peace. 

THE BANK. 

The Bank undertakes all the operations be- 
longing to the function of Circulation, and un- 
dertakes more than an ordinary bank. It dis- 
counts the obligations of commerce, collects and 
transmits funds, makes advances on annuities, 
on mortgages, on consignments, on industrial 
enterprises (of course in all such cases paying 
out its own notes), receives deposits, whether of 
the savings of individual workmen, or of as- 
sociations, or the money of other parties, etc. 
Though serving specially as the agent of the 
workmen, the Bank is entirely independent of 
them, does not participate in their enterprises, 
and is in no wise responsible for any of their 
losses. Even the Syndicates of Production and 
Consumption, though in the most intimate re- 
lations with the Bank, are individually distinct 
from it, each having for the purposes of its first 
organization its own particular capital. 



PBOUDHON 61 

There is no exclusion in the formation of the 
Bank ; all classes and all individuals may par- 
ticipate in its advantages. All persons may be- 
come what are called " adherents," or members, 
— that is, may agree to receive its notes in 
exchange for such articles as they may have to 
dispose of, also agreeing to purchase of other 
members what they have to buy. It is plain 
that, if adherents, using the notes, can buy 
cheaper than without them, everybody will de- 
sire to enjoy that benefit, and their general 
circulation will be insured ; and that even in- 
dividual dealers will sell cheaper to fellow 
members is plain from the fact that they will be 
controlled by the Syndicate of Consumption, 
with its great magazines and depots. 

What is the guaranty of these notes ? 

At the very start, in the mere infancy of the 
institution, they are guaranteed by these fifty 
to a hundred thousand workmen, — not as so 
many individuals, but as members of a compact 
and most efficient industrial organization, 
whereby they not only are justly paid, but pro- 
duce more than under the old system. More- 
over, this guaranty is constantly strengthened 



6&amp; PKOUDHON 

by the organization of similar bodies in all parts 
of the country, and by the steady growth of 
the operations of the Bank, which, from the 
necessity of things, if conducted with only 
tolerable skill and judgment, must soon include 
the whole productive industry of the nation in 
its sphere of action and as the elements of its 
power of usefulness. 

What the Bank issues in its notes is the 
credit of the people organized and employed 
for the benefit of the people, and impregnably 
fortified on each side by the organization of la- 
bor and of commerce. And let it be borne in 
mind that productive industry is the only real 
basis of credit. You may set up any number of 
fictions in regard to the matter, but this is al- 
ways the truth at the bottom. The difference 
between the Bank of the People and the old 
financial system is that in the former the credit 
of the community is controlled and used by the 
community solely for the furtherance of indus- 
try and the increase of its return to the indus- 
trious, while in the latter the same credit is in- 
geniously monopolized by a few, and used as an 
irresistible machine for levying upon industry 



PROUDHON 63 

the most exorbitant tribute for the benefit of 
the monopolizers. This is the fact in a nut- 
shell. Of all monopolies that of credit and the 
circulating medium is the worst. 

Let us sum up these statements : 

By* means of associations combined through 
the Syndicate of Production, industry is so or- 
ganized that the product goes to the producer. 

By means of the Syndicate of Consumption, 
the producers and consumers are brought into 
direct relations ; the poor buy on as good terms 
as the rich ; the workman is enabled to procure 
materials as well as the capitalist ; frauds and 
adulterations are prevented ; the number of 
agents of exchange is reduced to what is neces- 
sary; and, in a word, commerce becomes a 
strictly social function, regulated, like the 
management of schools, by the wishes and for 
the benefit of the community. 

By means of the Bank, a circulating medium 
is afforded, having the best possible guaranty, 
at the same time that it possesses the capacity 
of varying in quantity according to the necessi- 
ties of the public, which silver and gold can- 
not, — wherein lies one ground of the evil con- 



G4 PROTOHON 

nected with their use ; the rate of interest is re- 
duced to the cost of managing the business and 
meeting the contingencies of the Bank, — and 
that, let it be remembered, not nominally by 
an ineffectual usury law, but in fact ; and, in- 
terest being thus reduced to cost, which, in an 
institution covering a whole country, like 
France, and transacting all its business, as the 
Bank of the People in time surely would, would 
be the merest trifle, — say, one-half of one per 
cent. , — rents would at once fall to their just 
and natural level, and nobody would be able to 
make money by owning and letting houses or 
lands ; and at the same time the great function 
of credit and circulation would be in the hands 
of the producing class, who must also be the 
consuming class, and all speculating and living 
upon them would be at an end. 

Such are the fundamental institutions of the 
republic of wealth. Let the reader ponder 
them. They are worthy of reflection. 

HOW THE BANK OF THE PEOPLE WAS TO BE 

ORGANIZED. 

Though the Bank of the People, as an insti- 
tution of mutual credit and exchange, will need 



PROUDHOX 65 

no gold and silver as the instrument of its 
transactions when it is fully in motion, and 
when the whole nation are brought into it, it 
must at the outset be able to pay specie for its 
notes wherever specie is demanded. The Syn- 
dicates of Production and Consumption must 
also have a money capital, in order to the effi- 
cient commencement of their operations, and 
until the notes of the Bank shall have attained 
a general currency. 

The capital necessary for these purposes it 
was proposed to raise by shares bearing no in- 
terest and receiving no dividend. Of course 
only those interested in the realization of the 
scheme would subscribe. The capital of the 
Bank was fixed at 5,000,000 francs, of 5 francs 
each, operations to commence when 50,000 
francs was subscribed and paid in ; that of the 
Syndicate of Production at 1,000,000 francs, 
to commence when 25,000 were paid in ; and 
that of the Syndicate of Consumption at 
3,000,000 francs, of which the payment of 
50,000 was requisite to begin business. More- 
over, as soon as operations were commenced, a 
considerable amount of specie would constantly 



66 PROUDHON 

flow into the chest of the Bank from the wages 
of workmen, from other money brought to be 
exchanged for its notes, from deposits of sav- 
ings, etc. 

The subscription had begun, and, though not 
large, a sum would probably have been raised 
sufficient to start with, had not Proudhon's 
sentence for libel put an end to the execution of 
the scheme. It is now abandoned, or, rather, 
a better time is waited for; permanently laid 
aside it cannot be ; the movement at Paris is 
too strong to allow ideas so broad and fruitful 
to fail of a result. In one form or another they 
will ere long be tried. 

In this exposition our purpose has been more 
to set forth general principles than to explain 
particulars, though of the latter we have en- 
deavored to omit nothing essential. Indeed, 
the details are not in all cases yet worked out, 
and, where they are so, are perhaps often im- 
perfect. The grand scheme of labor, finance, 
and commerce, organized by association, is 
what we have endeavored to make plain, to- 
gether with the beneficial consequences to be 
expected therefrom. We ask the attention of 



PROUDHON 67 

our readers to the whole, but particularly to 
the reform of circulation and credit. In our 
judgment that is a subject which demands most 
careful consideration, especially in this country, 
for the circulation is the life-blood of the 
whole economical and industrial system, and in- 
terest of money constantly devours the fruit of 
industry. It is a stern and undeniable fact 
that a country which pays even live per cent, 
interest, to say nothing of the rates of Wall 
street, must from time to time commit bank- 
ruptcy, in order to rid itself of a burden of 
debts which it cannot discharge, its entire pro- 
perty having already passed into the hands of 
the creditors. The fact has hitherto not re- 
ceived the attention it merits, only because the 
creditors are in most cases within the country 
itself. 



THE END.

even five per cent, interest,
