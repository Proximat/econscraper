Is a post-growth company possible?
====================================
[January 19, 2023]()
[asemaphore-CSRinfluencers]()
Growth was and still is presented as the solution to any problem. Recently, amidst the climate crisis, growth supporters have tainted it with green. "If companies don't grow, how can they provide jobs? If there is no growth, how can States invest in cancer research?". It's highly likely that you have heard these arguments by anti-ecology or moderately in favour champions. The truth is that there is no evidence to support those claims.
[Growth is analysed through geographical expansion and monetary intensification]()
(scale and speed), meaning that more and more goods must be bought at an accelerated rate in a widely-spread geographical space (for example buying a new phone every year instead of every three years). For governments, this information is presented through economic data, mostly GDP. In fact, GDP gives no indication on how growth is distributed and on the type of flows.
[Jean Gadrey, French economist,]()
demonstrated that beyond $15 000 GDP, the average life satisfaction does not improve significantly more and beyond $18 000 per capita, life expectancy does not raise. The "more growth, more jobs" argument also falls against data : multinationals (more than 250 employees) do contribute to employment, however, only 1% of companies in Europe are considered as such. Most companies have less than 50 employees and in 2018, only 12% increased staff recruitment (data from Post-Growth Business report :
<
).
This observation led to thinkers to develop the degrowth theory, more aligned with the climate crisis: "A planned and democratic reduction of production and consumption in rich countries to reduce environmental pressures and inequality, while improving well-being.", as
[Timothee Parrique defines it]()
. In the 1970s, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen stated in "The Entropy Law and the Economic Process" that the linear consumption was incompatible with finite natural resources and suggested the
["bioeconomics theory"]()
in which biological, thermodynamics and planetary limits provide a frame to economics.
The idea is hence to
[meet our essential needs without compromising the planet's ecosystems and in fairer way]()
. It reminds me of the principles of the Doughnut Economy [read my French article
[here]()
], hence qualifying it as a degrowth theory, the question remains open. Some
[actions mentioned are]()
to specify the climate impact of goods, to give each consumer a carbon quota, to establish different pricing based on use (paying a higher price for water if it is going to be for your swimming pool rather than to drink), or to reduce working time.
**How does it translate into companies?**
A degrowth company would be defined as "sustainable environmentally (by respecting planetary boundaries), socially (by respecting the social foundation) and economically (by bringing prosperity)" according to Prophil Consultancy in its "Post-Growth for Business" report (Find the link to download it here:
<
). Two questions arise: 1) where is the degrowth component? And 2) how do they define prosperity?
To the first question, Prophil explains that entrepreneurs equate growth with profitability. Investments in hyper-growth companies do not always lead to profit (many startups are good examples of this). Moreover, growth is often followed by added bureaucracy, impacts on a company's culture, more workload, and potential lack of control on one's company in the long-term. As degrowth companies, they would aim to have net-zero impacts on the environment and for social justice. They would develop a sustainability strategy [Learn how to develop a sustainabble strategy with my article
[here]()
], a strategic governance, and evaluate their impacts. Of course, unsustainable activities would be abandoned. The idea is to be "
[sufficient]()
", meeting people's real needs rather than creating new ones. An example is Patagonia who sells sustainable clothing and fights overconsumption.
Still the question around prosperity remains. Here the Prophil's reports calls for "not-for-profit" companies which generate 50 % of their revenue "
[from sales of goods and services without private individual equity ownership]()
". It has nothing to do with charity, but includes foundation-owned companies, state enterprises, co-operatives etc. Not-for-profit companies make decisions based on their purpose instead of purely economic profits. Radically Open Security (ROS) defines itself as not-for-profit because it donates 90% of its revenue to their foundation whose purpose is to encourage open internet. ROS separates profit motive from their operations and the foundation owns 100% of shares, so the company cannot be sold. Lamazuna, vegan and zero waste household products, caps its growth to focus only on their eco-site.

specifically sells cloth that last long, so consumers don't need to buy new ones so often, a clearly post-growth strategy. Many companies are establishing sustainability activities and developing products alongside them, but still the main
[objective is profit-maximisation as their shareholding structures forced them]()
.
To summarise, a post-growth company has the following principles: 1) rather small and local; 2) a strategy to use resources within planetary boundaries including management, societal needs and well-being, circular economy, reparability etc. ; 3) a governance that sets how decisions are made. The research focus has been on inclusive collaborative value creation, decentralised centres of decisions, and even self-management; 4) a legal form, and a legal distinction between for-profit and not-for-profit; 5) a focus to wider social norms and a caring view where profit is a mean to achieve it rather the end-goal. (Principles developed in this research paper:
<
).
Milton Friedman once stated that the only purpose of a company is to make profit, and hence growth is the ultimate goal. With post-growth companies, we understand that it is rather a "
[matter of choice and social norms rather than a natural aspect of business]()
".
